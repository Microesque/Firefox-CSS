# Firefox-CSS - Microesque
Custom Firefox CSS I made for myself. Feel free to use or modify it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### How to use custom CSS with Firefox?
  - Navigate to `about:config`.
  - Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`.
  - Set the value to `true`.
  - Navigate to `about:profiles`.
  - Find the profile that is in use, and click `Open Folder` on its `Root Directory`.
  - Create a folder named `chrome`.
  - Copy the repository files into the `chrome` folder.
  - Restart Firefox.

### How to make basic modifications?
  - I put basic settings like color, size, and similar values that I thought I might want to change in the future into the `variables.css` file. You can modify them from there.
