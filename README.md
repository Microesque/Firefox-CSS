# Firefox-CSS - Microesque
Custom Firefox CSS I made for myself. Feel free to use or modify it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I've stopped updating for now since it's good enough for me. However, it’s still a work in progress, and I’ll get back to it eventually.

### Setup
  - Follow the [How to enable custom CSS for Firefox?](#how-to-enable-custom-css-for-firefox)
  - Make sure to use `horizontal tabs` and not `vertical tabs`.
  - Use the `default light theme`.
  - **Right-click** anywhere on the UI and click `Customize Toolbar`. Place the `Bookmarks toolbar items` element into the left toolbar by dragging.

### How to make basic modifications?
  - I put basic settings like color, size, and similar values that I thought I might want to change in the future into the `variables.css` file. You can modify them from there.

### Notes
  - This is a personal project, so it isn't tested thoroughly.
  - Only made for Windows. I don't know how it looks like on other OS.
